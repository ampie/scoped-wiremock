1. Move the RecordingSpecification logic to the server side
- Add the recordingSpecification as a property on the Mapping json structure
- Implement the rest CRUD endpoint at a different url, e.g. /extended_mappings
- Move the logic to determine which recording specifications are in scope to the server
- Mirror the scope tree on the server
-- may require moving ScopedScreenplay there, or otherwise just implement a scope object
-- may want to make CorrelatedScopeAdmin a bit more clever and group mappings per scope,
            maybe even a hierarchal StubMappings implementation

- Do the actual recording/playback on the server

2. Extend the EndPointConfigRegistry to return all mockable Endpoints within a certain scope
